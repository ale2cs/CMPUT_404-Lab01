Q2:
I already have the requests library installed and the version is 2.28.2.

Q3:
After installing the requests library with "pip install requests" in my 
virtualenv, the library is installed and the version is 2.31.0

Q4:
The difference between the virtual environment and the not virutal environment
python is that the virtual environment python has version 2.31.0 and the not 
virtual environment has version 2.28.2.

Q5:
The status code returned for http://google.com was 301 Moved Permanently. To get
the 200 status code we should use the url http://www.google.com.

Q6:
The status code returned for http://google.com was 418. The 418 status code was
returned by using both cur -i and curl -iL. When you curl 
http://www.google.com/teapot does not return a status code and only returns the
text.

Q7:
The output that used -X POST:
- Does not have <P>No form fields.
- Has <DT>X: <i>&lt;type 'instance'&gt;</i>
	  <DD>MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')
- Has <DT> CONTENT_LENGTH <DD> 3
      <DT> CONTENT_TYPE <DD> application/x-www-form 
- REMOTE_PORT is 33434 rather than 56598
- REQUEST_METHOD is POST instead of GET
- UNIQUE_ID is different.
Using -X POST would be useful when you need to make a post request.
